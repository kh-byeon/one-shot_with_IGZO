This code is based on [Siamese-Networks-for-One-Shot-Learning](https://github.com/tensorfreitas/Siamese-Networks-for-One-Shot-Learning)

## üîç Overview

We extend their implementation to support:
- On-device current base learning on analog in-memory distance computing hardware.
- Custom distance calculation using IGZO based circuit was implemented.
- After training with this code, hardware demonstration was performed on fabricated devices.

These modifications are introduced as part of our paper **"Title"** (arXiv/DOI link if available).
